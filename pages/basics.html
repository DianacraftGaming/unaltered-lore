            <h1>Basic Information</h1>
            <div class="note">
                <p class="lore">The Core of the World, Order, was shattered, and everything fell into Chaos. To restore and protect the world, three people claimed the shards of Order, acsending to godhood.</p>
                <p class="lore">But their power was too much to handle, making them lose themselves over time.</p>
                <p class="lore">The main story follows Samael, one of the three gods, and his escape from the other two, after their ideals no longer align.</p>

            <h1>Characters</h1>
            <div class="content">
                <h2>"MIND" | ???</h2>
                <p class="lore">The Shard of Mind, and the unofficial leader of the Trinity. As time went on, her paranoia made her into a control freak, going as far as to rewrite the consciousnesses of people who disagreed with her, with Samael being the most common victim.</p>
            </div>
            </br>
            <div class="content">
                <h2>"SPACE" | ???</h2>
                <p class="lore">The Shard of Space. She avoided taking sides in MIND and Samael's conflict, which only made it worse for the latter. Being the most stable out of the Trinity for a long time made SPACE believe the others might start targeting her, and broke her too.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <h2>"TIME" | Samael</h2>
                <p class="lore">The Shard of Time, Samael was erased and rewritten by MIND over and over, but a part of his true nature always stayed. Samael is the only of the three gods who did not renounce his name, but prefers it over his title. He escapes the two by pretending to go kill Kas, the just ascended god of Chaos.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <h2>Kas</h2>
                <p class="lore">King of the Konto kingdom. Despite being taught not to, Kas destroyed the seal that was placed on Chaos to get the power to avenge his parents and accidentally killed his entire kingdom in the process, falling into a depression until Samael would come to change that.</p>
